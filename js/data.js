Wow, I think to myself, maybe not letting the pressure and stress get to your head is the entire secret to being good at this game. Or maybe that I got to choose the first few categories that were my strengths helped. Or maybe playing Terry honed my buzzer skills more than Erika or Julia&rsquo;s games did for them!

I definitely thought, &ldquo;I could probably keep the lead even if I didn&rsquo;t answer anything.&rdquo; It was probably a bad idea to have that thought, especially since there was still a Daily Double up, because the complacency shut my brain down.

My poker face is terrible, but I'm trying to give a face that might be misconstrued as extreme disappointment in myself.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>It's become one of the greatest regrets in my life that I didn't turn and shake Erika and Julia's hands before walking over to Trebek, that I couldn't acknowledge how great the game was, that all I could manage was a glance over as I was already walking, a \"sorry for winning\" shrug.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>God, I hate winning. I seriously, genuinely prefer losing a game to feeling like a showboater and watching other people lose. My favorite outcomes are ones where I play hard and prove my aptitude or prowess, but then step aside to luck or a misstep and let someone else win.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>So I guess that'll lead us into the last two games, to be continued!</span></p>",

I take deep breaths, try to calm myself down, lower the volume of my pounding heart.

It is the cherry on top of the entire surreal experience so far.

For the last few moments, I find myself wondering how Trebek hurt his arm.</p>\n<p>The music starts, the music that will make my adrenaline surge to this day.

Bible Characters, near the top on my short list of unwanted categories.&nbsp;You can see Trebek glance over at the my small commotion.</p>\r\n<p>But the clue came up, and the answer came to mind early, and there was no doubt in my mind it was right. I hold my breath at the possibility Terry might have gotten it wrong, but when her correct answer appears, it oddly comes as a bit of a relief. When I step off the stage, all of my pent up vigor evaporates, and I feel exhausted.</p>",

Yet I was surprised at how calm I felt. This was the day, the big day, I&rsquo;d been waiting months for this day. Who knew what would happen in the next twelve hours? I think I was suppressing my thoughts lest I go crazy before I even make it to the studio.</p>\n<p>Skip ahead a bit. I think a girl wearing a green dress but not wearing a college sweatshirt was also waiting for the elevator, and a girl wearing a Harvard sweatshirt got on a few floors below. No one said a word. I didn&rsquo;t even look at them, just sort of grinned so they might know I understood the awkwardness of this elevator ride.</p>\n<p>Cut to the hotel lobby, where around fifteen students and most of their parents are standing in a circle making small talk with each other. I fall into the familiar habit of not saying a word and listening to others like a good introvert. This is where I get my first good look at most of the other competitors. You could tell Jeopardy! selected for a very bright and attractive group, which made me feel a bit proud to be included, but also inevitably self-conscious.</p>\n<p>Onto the bus, where I sit by myself, thinking I could have brought a bag like everyone else. Maggie keeps us enthralled for most of the trip. She&rsquo;s absolutely amazing, and I&rsquo;ve been telling myself to send her an e-mail just thanking her for everything she did and the whole experience, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like the right time yet. I watch LA pass by, still looking for some last minute tidbits of trivia to pick up from billboards or restaurant signs. No dice. I pick up a sample question Maggie gives from Entourage -&gt; Ari -&gt; Arizona, something picked up via a very common crossword clue, and something most of the bus seemed to not know, so I feel like that&rsquo;s a solid start to the day.</p>\n<p>A whirlwind of a morning. Hanging out in the green room, signing forms, getting makeup, listening to Maggie&rsquo;s enthralling speeches. They call us in small groups outside to record some interviews, and I&rsquo;m the last person they call. Glenn leads me past the life-size cutout of Trebek and around the corner, and suddenly, I&rsquo;m on set. I can see the giant game board, the podiums, the tastefully colored backgrounds (technically this is a set I&rsquo;ve never seen before on TV, but the features are there). The cameras, the rows of seats for the audience, the judges&rsquo; and producers&rsquo; tables. I desperately want to take pictures.</p>\n<p>More of a blur. All of us gather behind the podiums to hear more about the game. The screens, the buzzers, the view of the game board and the cameras. It is incredibly surreal. There isn&rsquo;t any other way to describe it. You almost never see more than four people on set, and it feels like such a controlled and tight operation on TV, but now suddenly you see technicians and cameramen and producers walking around, adjusting things, talking to each other. It&rsquo;s freaky. Maybe what gets to me the most is I can look wherever I want. I can stare at the gameboard, or the backdrop, and admire its size and the colors for as long as I want, not just while the camera is focused on it. What a random thing to be impressed by! I guess it just hammered home how lucky I was to be where I was.</p>\n<p>Rehearsal heightens how eerie it feels, to be pushing the buzzer, shouting out &ldquo;What is&hellip;&rdquo; answers, <em>playing the game</em>. My inner self shuddered when I answer my first question, but then my brain takes over and leave no room for raw emotions. Playing Jeopardy! in person demands your full attention. No room for feelings, no room for worrying or feeling nervous or self-conscious, no room for even recording memories, it seems.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re led into the green room to await the first game. I play Jenga to ease my nerves, but it turns out that Jenga only makes people even more high-strung. Shaun of the Dead goes up on the TV, and having never seen it, I half-watch it, half try to suppress my internal panic. I&rsquo;m thinking, how do I not panic, how do I not make a fool of myself on television, how do I memorize more information in these last hours? Another three people are called out. The remaining students try to make light of the situation. The alternates, Gus and Sam, are the least nervous by far and helping to keep us all sane, to which I must be forever grateful.</p>\n<p>Almost exactly at the end of the movie, Maggie comes in and announces Kenesha, Terry, and I will be playing the last game before lunch. Three of the quiet people, who know nothing about each other at this point. I feel calmer than I expected, but that might have been a delusion at this point! I&rsquo;m thinking purely in aphorisms, relevant or not, as my brain diverts all of its raw computational power to playing the game. Cares to the wind, balls to the wall, no guts no glory, make it or break it, no turning back now, as the three of us are led past the Trebek cardboard cutout, around the corner, and onto the set.</p>",

I watch LA pass by, still looking for some last minute tidbits of trivia to pick up from billboards or restaurant signs. No dice.

You almost never see more than four people on set, and it feels like such a controlled and tight operation on TV, but now suddenly you see technicians and cameramen and producers walking around, adjusting things, talking to each other. It&rsquo;s freaky. Maybe what gets to me the most is I can look wherever I want. I can stare at the gameboard, or the backdrop, and admire its size and the colors for as long as I want, not just while the camera is focused on it. What a random thing to be impressed by! I guess it just hammered home how lucky I was to be where I was.</p>\n<p>Rehearsal heightens how eerie it feels, to be pushing the buzzer, shouting out &ldquo;What is&hellip;&rdquo; answers,&nbsp;<em>playing the game</em>.

My first stop the day after I got home was the local library. I planned to devour almanacs and general knowledge books. Books like </span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/An-Incomplete-Education-Learned-Probably/dp/0345468902\">&ldquo;An Incomplete Education&rdquo;</a><span> and </span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/York-Times-Guide-Essential-Knowledge/dp/0312643020\">&ldquo;The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge&rdquo;</a><span>. Great books, books that held a tremendous wealth of information: German opera composers to French Modernist painters, Academy Award winning films to constellations, Supreme Court cases to Baseball Hall of Famers. Everything you could imagine would ever appear in a Jeopardy! question.</span></p>\n<p>On one hand, it was tremendously foolish to think I&rsquo;d be able to get through the tomes, and it turned out to be silly to think it would help at all. On the other, I definitely rekindled my love of trivia in those few weeks.</p>\n<p>As a child, I&rsquo;d absorbed books. I remember three specific books that I read religiously: a trivia book with 1000 (5000? 10000) fun facts, &ldquo;The Twentieth Century, Year by Year&rdquo; (a huge coffee table book with a two-page spread for each of the hundred years), and the dictionary. I seriously loved reading the dictionary, finding new words, adding to the knowledge in my belt. I was an information addict. All of that waned as my responsibilities in the real world increased, but I guess that&rsquo;s the answer to all the &ldquo;how do you know so much stuff?&rdquo; questions I get&ndash;I devoured information from a very young age.</p>\n<p>So the studying process was like a nostalgia trip. It&rsquo;d been a while since I&rsquo;d just sat down and enjoyed the drug that is raw information, trivia, stats, figures, facts. I hadn&rsquo;t even seen the show Jeopardy! since high school.</p>\n<p>But then one problem cropped up: I&rsquo;d now completely lost the ability to retain the knowledge I acquired. On something as simple as the world capitals, I&rsquo;d drill myself on a small number of countries and half an hour later be completely unable to remember any of their capitals. If I&rsquo;d set my mind to it when I was younger, memorizing all of the capitals would have taken less than a day of focused study, as it was with state capitals, digits of pi, or elements of the periodic table. This was worrying both in regards to Jeopardy! and the state of my brain&ndash;was my potential for learning done? Was my method of studying flawed, or should I somehow not have wasted all the space in my head?</p>\n<p>I also watched plenty of old episodes and played plenty of practice games on j-archive. I realized a) I would have fared much better as a high-schooler, when all the history and biology and literature was fresh in my head and when I still had my memory fully intact, and b) the game is a lot harder than you remember. I definitely used to think that I had 90% of the questions on Jeopardy! down while I was playing along in front of the TV. It&rsquo;s not till you start playing seriously and tracking your performance that you realize how quickly you forget about and disregard those Broadway theater or art history or 1950s television categories that utterly stump you. You take your wordplay category and your high school knowledge categories and run both of them, and you think the game is easy. But noo. Here comes British Royalty or Russian playwrights or Phoenicia to mess your day up. On the show, you can&rsquo;t just pretend a category doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>\n<p>Either way, let&rsquo;s get to my final point: cramming was totally inefficient. Jeopardy! is unfathomably fast, primarily because if you&rsquo;re buzzing in, you&rsquo;ve read the whole clue and jumped on an answer (question) in less time than it takes Trebek to read the clue aloud. Except for maybe two or three of them, every single answer (question) I gave was something I&rsquo;d known for years and could recall instantly. Lists of Supreme Court justices and even world capitals never came to mind.<em><br/></em></p>\n<p>So my weeks of studying were mostly for naught, but I suppose I may have reviewed the information I did know, strengthened those connections in my head. And at least I got to relive the joy of trivia before I went on the show.</p>",

I don&rsquo;t want to tell anyone because who knows what will happen, what if they find out they called the wrong person or Jeopardy! gets canceled or I miss my flight out to the taping or I die in an ironic accident? Oh my god, what if I die before I can tell anyone? What if no one ever knows? I am suddenly terrified of dying, this is no joke. I have to take the train and then drive home the next day and the entire time I am freaking out about crashing or derailing or an earthquake or an aneurysm or an airstrike prematurely ending my Jeopardy! dreams.

                "body": "<p>The audition really doesn&rsquo;t merit it&rsquo;s own full post. It&rsquo;d just be a recap of an ancient event I kind of sort of remember. It might be more useful to jump to part 6 and get my most recent thoughts down before they cool off. But this ain&rsquo;t gonna be no Slaughterhouse-Five.</p>\n<p>There isn&rsquo;t a ton to talk about, or maybe I&rsquo;ve already forgotten it all. I got to the hotel, joined the fifteen or so awkwardly milling around people in the upstairs foyer, and pretended to have something engrossing to do on my phone. I think I did a crossword. One guy showed up wearing a Cal polo, so of course I went way out of my comfort zone and said hi to him. Another Cal student also showed up, so we had a small chat before Robert came out and started taking our pictures.</p>\n<p>During Robert and Corina&rsquo;s extremely high-energy speech at us, I remember looking around and scoping out the College competition. It was somewhat depressing how capable everyone seemed. They seemed confident, sociable, bright, and definitely had an average of 3 points on me in looks. There were around five tall, blond athletes of both genders. Wasn&rsquo;t this just the audition? Didn&rsquo;t completely un-TV friendly people get into the audition too? A couple other Asian guys, and I think there weren&rsquo;t any Asian girls (would I remember something like that?). One Indian guy who went to Cal. I guess it was a pretty racist audition, or I just don&rsquo;t remember any non-Caucasian/Asian people there.</p>\n<p>I felt plenty excited, but it was ten in the morning and I had no energy and probably could barely open my eyes (asian joke). And now I don&rsquo;t even remember what order things happened in; I think we took the test first. On the test, I got William and Harry mixed up, didn&rsquo;t know my cabinet members or who invented the internet, and guessed Falstaff for some random fat knight question. (Only the name occurred to me at this point&ndash;I was later inspired to read up on Falstaff simply because I&rsquo;d guessed it here. Good stuff.)</p>\n<p>The interview (and the whole audition) might be one of my prouder moments in life. I successfully spent the entire three hours or so pretending to be a very well-adjusted extrovert. At the time I wasn&rsquo;t sure how successful I was (only in hindsight can I say I definitely did well), but I left feeling pretty comfortable that I&rsquo;d made a nice impression. During the interview, I stood up straight, spoke loudly and clearly, made eye contact with Robert and Corina (ugh, eye contact), and cracked some random jokes. I riffed on using my hypothetical winnings to buy a trip to space; I still can&rsquo;t decide whether or not that&rsquo;s corny or brilliant. (Also later inspired to actually look up the prices of space trips&ndash;in the range of &gt;$250,000. Good thing no one there really knew either. And anyone who knows me knows that any prize money was going straight into the bank). Most other people did fine as well; I don&rsquo;t really want to mention it, but there were definitely a couple people who bombed the interview.</p>\n<p>Now that I think about it I might have succeeded precisely because I was an Asian guy trying to emulate outspoken white people. The other three or four Asian guys were all (ugh, stereotypically) meek and softspoken. Besides one Asian guy, whose interview I can&rsquo;t remember. I remember being worried about him, since he seemed pretty comfortable with talking and had a pretty good TV presence, until he said something undeniably and absurdly pretentious. He might have referred to himself as a genius or something along those lines. Sad that I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>\n<p>I left feeling like I did well. I got in the car and I told my family that my interview went great, and I was just unsure about my test results. But we knew it was a crapshoot from this point on. We collectively accepted that even if this was the last I ever heard from Jeopardy! (for this year), it was a worthwhile experience. We went to Chinatown, walked around, and got some food.</p>\n<p>I promptly forgot about the interview for the rest of the year. When I got back to Oregon and people asked when they could see me on TV, I told them not to wait. Within the week the whole thing passed out of my memory.</p>\n<p>(Man I want to write about the meatier things before I forget them this sucks)</p>",

During the interview, I stood up straight, spoke loudly and clearly, made eye contact with Robert and Corina (ugh, eye contact), and cracked some random jokes. I riffed on using my hypothetical winnings to buy a trip to space; I still can&rsquo;t decide whether or not that&rsquo;s corny or brilliant. (Also later inspired to actually look up the prices of space trips&ndash;in the range of &gt;$250,000. Good thing no one there really knew either.
